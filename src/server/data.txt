@realDonaldTrump Mar30 Inverview FoxAndFriends
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:55 A.M. USA STRONG!
@realDonaldTrump Mar29 2900 bed hospital
So proud of the @USACEHQ, @FEMA, and the Federal Government for the 2,900 bed hospital they built in 4 days (way ahead of schedule) in the Javits Center for NY. We are now moving the teams to join others so they can continue to build more hospitals/beds. Keep up the GREAT WORK!
@realDonaldTrump Mar29 2900 news conference
Will be starting The White House news conference at 5:15 P.M. Eastern.
@realDonaldTrump Mar31 automobile companies
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3500, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Positive impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
@realDonaldTrump Mar31 us auto workers
My Administration is helping U.S. auto workers by replacing the failed Obama Emissions Rule. Impossible to satisfy its Green New Deal Standard; Lots of unnecessary and expensive penalties to car buyers!
@realDonaldTrump Apr04 Masks
We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. “P Act” all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!
@realDonaldTrump Apr02 Oil price 2
.....Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels. Good (GREAT) news for everyone!
@realDonaldTrump Apr02 Oil price 1
Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!
@realDonaldTrump Apr02 Medical supplies stocked up 2
....have been stocked up and ready long before this crisis hit. Other states are thrilled with the job we have done. Sending many Ventilators today, with thousands being built. 51 large cargo planes coming in with medical supplies. Prefer sending directly to hospitals.
@realDonaldTrump Apr02 Medical supplies stocked up 1
Massive amounts of medical supplies, even hospitals and medical centers, are being delivered directly to states and hospitals by the Federal Government. Some have insatiable appetites & are never satisfied (politics?). Remember, we are a backup for them. The complainers should
@realDonaldTrump Apr02 Military distributing goods 2
...It wouldn’t matter if you got ten times what was needed, it would never be good enough. Unlike other states, New York unfortunately got off to a late start. You should have pushed harder. Stop complaining & find out where all of these supplies are going. Cuomo working hard!
@realDonaldTrump Apr02 Military distributing goods 1
Somebody please explain to Cryin’ Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods, a very talented Admiral, in fact. New York has gotten far more than any other State, including hospitals & a hospital ship, but no matter what, always complaining...
@realDonaldTrump Apr01 Iran troops
Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq. If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!
@realDonaldTrump Apr01 Deductibility by buisnesses
Congress must pass the old, and very strongly proven, deductibility by businesses on restaurants and entertainment. This will bring restaurants, and everything related, back - and stronger than ever. Move quickly, they will all be saved!
@realDonaldTrump Mar31 safe vehicles rule
Great news! American families will now be able to buy safer, more affordable, and environmentally friendly cars with our new SAFE VEHICLES RULE. Get rid of those old, unsafe clunkers. Build better and safer American cars and create American jobs. Buy American!
@realDonaldTrump Mar31 Interest rates zero
With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4
@realDonaldTrump Mar31 Morning tv with nancy pelosi
I watched a portion of low rated Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say, & what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country. Actually, other than her usual complaining that I’m a terrible person, she wasn’t bad. Still praying!
@realDonaldTrump Mar30 Workers Help/Stimulus Bill
Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats delayed the Workers Help/Stimulus Bill by over a week, trying to add real junk into the Bill. Got some bad things, having nothing to do with those affected by the Virus, included. Republicans need their votes until we WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020!

@TheeNerdwriter Aug15 Music on Super Nintendo
I've loved @David_Wise's "Aquatic Ambiance" ever since I was a kid. So I decided to explore how beautiful music like that was made with the (relatively) primitive tools of the SUPER NINTENDO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvIzIAgRWV0
